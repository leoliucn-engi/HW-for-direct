    "Purpose:\n",
    "To develop a high-throughput computational workflow and analysis code for multi-component liquid electrolytes within the framework of the Materials Project infrastructure to handle both practical aspects (input file generation, output file parsing, and information management) as well as more complex problems (structure matching, salt complex generation, and failure recovery).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: \n",
    "Present benchmark data on basis sets and functionals on the G2-97 test set; A IP/EA calculation method that combines PBE geometry optimization and B3LYP energy evaluation requires less computational cost and yields nearly identical results as compared to a full B3LYP calculation, and could be suitable for the calculation of large molecules. Their data indicates that among the 8 functionals tested, XYGJ-OS and B3LYP are the two best functionals to predict IP/EA with an RMSE of 0.12 and 0.27 eV, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How dose it work:\n",
    "The infrastructure is largely open-source and handles both practical aspects (input file generation, output file parsing, and information management) as well as more complex problems (structure matching, salt complex generation, and failure recovery). Using this infrastructure to compute the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinities (EA) of 4830 molecules relevant to battery electrolytes (encompassing almost 55,000 quantum mechanics calculations) at the B3LYP/ 6-31+G‚ÅÑ level. They describe automated workflows for computing redox potential, dissociation constant, and salt-molecule binding complex structure generation. We present routines for automatic recovery from calculation errors, which brings the failure rate from 9.2% to 0.8% for the QChem DFT code. Automated algorithms to check duplication between two arbitrary molecules and structures are described.\n",
